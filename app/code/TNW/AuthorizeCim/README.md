## Installation
In your Magento 2 root directory run  
`composer require tnw/module-authorizenetcim`  
`bin/magento setup:upgrade`

## Configuration
The configuration can be found in the Magento 2 admin panel under  
Store->Configuration->Sales->Payment Methods->Authorize.net CIM  

#### Accept.js and Test mode
Test Mode requires your checkout and admin pages use the HTTPS protocol even
in your staging development environments. The correct version of Accetp.js,
https://jstest.authorize.net/v1/Accept.js, is loaded when the module is in test
mode, but it will error if you attempt to use it over HTTP. You do NOT need a
valid SSL certificate for testing.
